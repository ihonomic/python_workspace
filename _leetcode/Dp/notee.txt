Bottom- up : 
    Selecting the smallest values of the input, slowly increasing the input argument value. 
    Solve and save in a table. As larger input surfaces, they can use from the smallest outcomes. 

Top - down: 
    problem is broken into sub-problems and sloved, cached, always checking if results already been solved 

DIFFERENCES:
    - In bottom-up the programmer has to select what values get computed first & decide the order of calculation
    - Top down, . The problem is broken into sub problems, these sub problems are solved and the solutions remembered, 
        in case they need to be solved again.

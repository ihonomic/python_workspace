""" Question 16 - Subarray sort
    Given an array, return the start and end indexes of the smallest subarray from the input that need to be sorted to
    make the entire array sorted. If the entire is already sorted, return [-1, -1]
    e.g : [0,1,2,5,4,7,3,6,8,9],--> [3, 7]
    The subarray =[5,4,7,3,6] need to be sorted to make the entire array sorted
    
    Method 1: 0(n) time | 0(1) space
        Note: if one number is found unsorted, that means two is unsorted, 
        The subarray is dependent on the values that are out of order.
            (where the min and max values are suppose to be)
    - The idea is to find the minimum and maximum value that are out of order.
    - Find the position index of where both the minimum value and maximum value are
        suppose to be

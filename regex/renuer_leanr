ASSIGNMENT 

How many words in the dictionary contain "a" (not necessarily the first letter) followed by 3-5 characters, then "b" followed by 3-5 characters, then "c"?
What is the last word in the dictionary that contains "ee" and also "oo", in that order, but not necessarily adjacent?
How many words in the dictionary contain either "aeu" or "au", then followed by "s"?

1. re.compile(r'a.{3,5}b.{3,5}c')
2. re.compile(r'ee.*oo')
3. re.compile(r'ae?us')

Find all words in the dictionary that contain two consonants (i.e., non-vowels), two vowels, and then either "p" or "r". These letters should be consecutive, and can be at the beginning, middle, or end of a word.
Find all words that contain "e", "f", "g", and/or "h" three times in a row, then any letter, and then "m", "n", and/or "o" twice in a row.
Find words that contain a "q" followed by something other than "u".


1. re.compile(r'\w*[^aeiou]{2}[aeiou]{2}[pr]\w*')
2. re.compile(r'[efgh]{3}\w[mno]{2}')
3. re.compile(r'q[^u]')

ANCHORS allow us to specify what it must start or end with a certain pattern.
"^abc" means that the letter "a" must be at the start of a string. - All that ends with vowels [aeiou]$ 
Words that starts with vowels and end with vowels ^[aeiou]\w*[^aeiou]$

Find all words in the dictionary that start with a capital vowel and contain at least 8 letters
Find all words in the dictionary, at least 5 letters long, whose first letter isn't capitalized, whose second letter is a vowel, and whose third-to-last letter is either "x", "y", or "z"
Find all lowercase words in the dictionary that contain three vowels in a row, but in which that three-vowel sequence is at least 5 characters after the front of the word and also 5 characters before the end of the word.

1.  re.compile(r'^[AIEOU]\w{7,}')
2.  re.compile(r'^[a-z][aeiou]\w*[xyz]\w{2}$')
2.  re.compile(r'^\w{5,}[aeiou]{3}\w{5,}$')

Find the middle two digits from US-style Social Security numbers (###-##-####)
Find all words in the dictionary that start with "ex" and end with either 's' or "sing".
Find all words in which "la" appears at least twice in a row.
In words containing "la" at least twice in a row, find the first two letters.  (Note that the first two letters shouldn't be "la".  So if the word starts with "la", there will need to be a separate "lala" later on.)

s= ###-##-####
1. re.findall('(\d{3}-(\d{2})-\d{4})', s)
2. re.compile('^ex\w*s(ing)?$')
3. re.compile('(la){2, }')
4. re.compile('^(\w{2})(la){2, }')

ALTERNATIONS - It allows us to say that we want one thing or another, but not both (cat|dog), a(b|c|d)e

Find all words that contain either "oo" or "ee" immediately after the letter "r" and before any of the letters "p", "s", or "t".
Find words in the dictionary that start with "b" and have either three vowels or three consonants (i.e., non-vowels) in a row.
Find words that contain, inside of them, the words "small", "medium", or "large".

1. re.compile('r(oo|ee)[pst]')
1. re.compile('^b\w*([aeiou]{3}|[^aeiou]{3})')
1. re.compile('.*(small|medium|large).*')
